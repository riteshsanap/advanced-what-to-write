# Advanced What to write next about?

This is plugin is based and inspired by "What should we write about next" by Vladimir prelovac.

The feedbacks are sent by AJAX, and the plugin has a backened panel for moderating Feedbacks where you can mark feedbacks as Spam, Approve or even delete them after reading.
